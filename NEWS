0.7.0 (2012-01-23)
======================

Features
--------
 - Added method wokkel.data_form.Form.typeCheck for type checking incoming Data
   Forms submissions against field definitions.
 - Added method wokkel.data_form.Form.makeFields to add fields from a
   dictionary mapping field names to values.
 - Added public function wokkel.data_form.findForm for extracting Data Forms
   from stanzas.
 - PubSubRequest.options is now a wokkel.data_form.Form.
 - wokkel.data_form.Form can now be used as a read-only dictionary.
 - Added support for configuration options in Publish-Subscribe node create
   requests.
 - Added support for subscription options in Publish-Subscribe subscribe
   requests (#63).
 - Added support for Publish Subscribe subscription identifiers.
 - wokkel.pubsub.Item can now be used to send out notifications, too.
 - Added a twistd plugin to set up a basic XMPP server that accepts component
   connections and provides server-to-server (dialback) connectivity.
 - Added support for managing affiliations of Publish-Subscribe nodes,
   server-side.
 - Added iq request (set/get) tracking to StreamManager and provide a new base
   class for such requests: wokkel.generic.Request. Unlike
   twisted.words.protocols.jabber.xmlstream.IQ, Such requests can be queued
   until the connection is initialized, with timeouts running from the moment
   `request` was called (instead of when it was sent over the wire).
 - Added support for Delayed Delivery information formats.
 - Added support for XMPP Multi-User Chat, client side (#24).

Fixes
-----

 - XMPP Ping handler now marks incoming ping requests as handled, so the
   FallbackHandler doesn't respond, too. (#66)
 - Incorporate Twisted changes for component password hashes.
 - Completed test coverage for Data Forms.
 - Made sure Data Forms field labels don't get overwritten (#60).
 - Service Discovery identity is now reported correctly for legacy
   PubSubService use (#64).
 - Various smaller Service Discovery fixes for PubSubService.
 - Completed test coverage for Service Discovery support.
 - Publish Subscribe events with stanza type error are now ignored (#69).
 - Publish Subscribe requests with multiple 'verbs' are now properly parsed
   (#72).
 - Publish Subscribe requests that have no legacy support in PubSubService will
   now result in a feature-not-implemented error (#70).
 - Publish Subscribe subscription elements now have the correct namespace when
   sent out.
 - Incorporated Twisted changes for passing on a reason Failure upon stream
   disconnect.
 - Fixed race condition and nesting issues when adding subprotocol handlers to
   their StreamManager (#48).
 - Reimplemented Service Discovery requests using new Request class. By reusing
   common code, this fixes a problem with requests without addressing (#73).
